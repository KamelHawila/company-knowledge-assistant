# Company Knowledge Assistant (RAG)

Production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant for internal company knowledge.

## Goal
Build an end-to-end RAG system using:
- Embeddings
- Vector search
- RAG pipeline + prompt rules
- LangChain (later, after building from scratch)
- Streamlit deployment

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` experiments + learning deliverables
- `src/` core reusable code
- `app/` Streamlit UI
- `data/` sample documents (raw/processed)
- `diagrams/` architecture visuals

## Roadmap Deliverables
- `01_llm_fundamentals.ipynb`
- `02_retrieval_engine.ipynb`
- `03_rag_pipeline.ipynb`
- `04_langchain_version.ipynb`
